&lt;p&gt;These Merchant Terms of Use (the Terms) govern your use of the products, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities (the Services) provided by SemitePay, Inc. (SemitePay, we, our, or us) through SemitePay’s website, API or through any other means. &lt;b&gt;You&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;your&lt;/b&gt; mean the merchant to which we will be providing the Services and the person signing below or otherwise agreeing to the Terms on behalf of the merchant. Please read the Terms carefully; by using the Services, you agree to the Terms and confirm that you accept them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-services&quot;&gt;The Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a SemitePay payment processor—we enable you to accept payment for goods or services, and process payments that you receive from your customers. We are not a currency exchanger or a place to purchase any currency. By using the Services, you authorize us to receive, hold and disburse funds on your behalf and to take any and all actions that we think are necessary or desirable to provide the Services and to comply with applicable law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;registration&quot;&gt;Registration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Generally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use the Services, you must open a SemitePay account. When you open an account, we will ask you for contact information such as, for instance, your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and website. The information that you provide at the time of account opening must be accurate and complete, and you must inform us in a timely fashion of any changes to such information. We may require additional information about you (including any person signing below or otherwise agreeing to the Terms on behalf of the merchant) such as, for instance, your date of birth, tax identification number or government-issued identification, and we may also obtain information about you from third parties, such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. We have the right to reject your account registration, or to later close your SemitePay account, if you do not provide us with accurate, complete and satisfactory information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Merchant Tiers&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SemitePay imposes daily transaction processing limits on merchants. When you register for a SemitePay account, you will be required to select the limit (the Tier) that will apply to your SemitePay account, and to provide us with the documentation necessary to qualify for that Tier. A description of the Tiers, as well as a list of the documentation required to qualify for each, is available on our website. If your business is a High Risk category, as determined by SemitePay, you will be required to qualify for the “Trusted” Tier in order to use the Services. We will not begin to process payments on your behalf until we have reviewed the documentation that you provide, in accordance with applicable law. If you wish to change to a Tier with a higher limit, you must provide us with the additional required documentation. We will not approve your request to change Tiers and permit you a greater processing volume unless and until we have reviewed your documentation to our satisfaction. Please also refer to Section 3.1, “Daily Transaction Volume; Tiers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Guarding your Password&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will choose a password when registering. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur using your password or account. Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. You may not use anyone else’s password at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Prohibited Accounts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of the Services is subject to the laws and regulations of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) regarding the prevention of terrorist financing and anti-money laundering. You agree and acknowledge that your use of the Services would and will comport with such laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) Department of the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-sales&quot;&gt;Your Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Daily Transaction Volume; Tiers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You agree to adhere to the transaction processing limits applicable to your Tier. You agree that, if you exceed that limit, SemitePay has the right to hold the over-the-limit funds until you have provided us with the additional documentation required to qualify for the next Tier, and until we have had the opportunity to review such documents. We will take additional measures if you exceed your limit. If you are a “Trusted” merchant, you may create an unlimited value of invoices (see Section 8.1), although you will only receive payments from us up to the specified limit. If you are not a “Trusted” merchant, you may not create a value of invoices that exceeds your specified limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Invoices and Records&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must keep all records needed for fulfilling the merchandise to the purchaser and providing any post-sale support to the purchaser. If the sale of the item requires any government registration of the sale, you are responsible for such registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Customer Verification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are solely responsible for obtaining any information required of those who purchase your goods or services. For instance, if applicable law prohibits a sale to persons under the age of 18 years, you must ensure that a purchaser is at least 18 years of age. Similarly, if applicable law requires that a purchaser’s identity be verified, you must verify the purchaser’s identity. We will not be responsible for your failure to adequately verify your purchasers’ identities or qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prohibited&quot;&gt;Representation and Warranties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your use of the Services is subject to several important restrictions. Specifically, you represent and warrant to us that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(f) You have the right, power and ability to enter into and perform under these Terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Our Right to Reject&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reserve the right to decline to process a sale if we believe that it violates these Terms or would expose you, other merchants, purchasers, or other parties to harm. If we reasonably suspect that your SemitePay account has been used for an illegal purpose, you authorize us to share information about you, your SemitePay account, and your account activity with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Our Right to Inspect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may ask for permission to inspect your business location, in connection with your use of the Services or specific transactions. If you refuse our request, we may suspend or terminate your SemitePay account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;third-parties&quot;&gt;Third Parties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Your Use of Third-Party Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In using the SemitePay website or the Services, you may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties. If you decide to use these third-party services, you do so at your own risk and are solely responsible for reviewing, understanding and complying with the associated terms and conditions. We expressly disclaim any liability for the third-party services and are not responsible for the performance of the third-party services or servicers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have implemented security measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will never gain access to your information, and you acknowledge that you provide your information at your own risk, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collect-use-share&quot;&gt;How we Collect, Use and Share Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to provide the Services, we may share information about you and your SemitePay account with third parties, including but not limited to your bank and purchasers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-ownership&quot;&gt;Our Ownership of the Services and the SemitePay Website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You agree and acknowledge that we own all right, title and interest to and in the Services, the associated software, technology tools and content, the SemitePay website, the content displayed on the website, and other materials produced by and related to SemitePay (collectively, the SemitePay IP). You are only permitted to use the Services and the SemitePay IP to accept and receive payments, according to these Terms. When you accept the Terms, we grant you a personal, limited, revocable and non-transferable license to use the SemitePay IP, without the right to sublicense. You shall not rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, transfer, copy, reproduce, download, display, modify or timeshare the SemitePay IP or any portion thereof, or use the SemitePay IP as a component of or a base for products or services prepared for commercial sale, sublicense, lease, access or distribution. You shall not prepare any derivative work based on the Company IP, nor shall you translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Company IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advertising&quot;&gt;Advertising&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mutual consent, we may publish your corporate name, artwork, text and logo &lt;b&gt;(Merchant Content)&lt;/b&gt; on the SemitePay website and promotional materials to acknowledge you as our customer. You represent and warrant to us that you have the right to provide the Merchant Content to us, and that the use, copying, modification and publication of the Merchant Content by us: (a) will not infringe, violate or misappropriate any third party copyright, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights, (b) will not infringe any rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) will not be defamatory or obscene or otherwise violate any law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fees-and-settlement&quot;&gt;Fees &amp;amp; Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Invoice Generation and Exchange Rate Guarantee&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an invoice, you may post a request to SemitePay to collect a specific amount in your local currency, such as dollars or euros, or in Bitcoin. SemitePay will pull the exchange rate and provide the Bitcoin payment instructions to the purchaser. We guarantee the exchange rate to you as long as the purchaser pays within the proper time window after the invoice is created. Invoice timeout information is clearly displayed on each SemitePay invoice. While we guarantee the exchange rate as long as the purchaser pays within such time window, you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your local currency or Bitcoin, as applicable. For instance, if you ask us to collect USD $150, and the purchaser sends the payment within the time window, we guarantee you will receive exactly USD $150, minus our fee, but do not guarantee the value of the U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fees&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We charge a processing fee on all transactions. The proceeds payable to you will equal the amount of the invoice (assuming that we have received the full amount of the invoice from the purchaser), unless you agree to accept less than the amount of the invoice, minus the processing fee. We reserve the right to change our fees and will give you 30 calendar days’ prior notice of any fee increase. Your continued use of the Services after we notify you of any increase in our fees constitutes your acceptance of such change. Current pricing information is provided on the SemitePay website at https://semitepayment.com/pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Methods of Settlement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will clear the payments over the Bitcoin peer-to-peer payment network and post the balance to your accounting ledger, according to your preference settings. The debits and credits to your accounting ledger are funds temporarily held by SemitePay until settlement to your bank account can take place. You can receive a settlement in your local currency, in Bitcoins, or in a mixture of both. You assume volatility risks of the currency in which you choose to be settled. If you choose to keep bitcoins, then you assume the volatility risk of the bitcoin value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Settlements in Local Currencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct deposit to a bank account in a local currency is available to merchants located in certain countries. Please refer to Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://SemitePay.com/bitcoin-direct-deposit&quot;&gt;https://semitepayment.com/direct-deposit&lt;/a&gt; for a list of those countries. If you wish to receive direct deposit, you must provide us with valid bank account information and keep such information current. We will send a direct deposit to your bank account to clear out your accumulated balance. Minimum settlement amounts apply; please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://SemitePay.com/bitcoin-direct-deposit&quot;&gt;https://semitepayment.com/direct-deposit&lt;/a&gt; for information related to minimum settlement amounts and deposit frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Your Bank Account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must provide us with written notice at least 1 business day prior to closing your bank account. If you wish to continue to receive direct deposits, you must provide us with information for a substitute bank account. You are solely liable for all fees and costs associated with your bank account and for all overdrafts. You authorize us to initiate electronic credits to your bank account at any time, as necessary to process your transactions. We will not be liable for any delays in receipt of funds or errors in bank account entries caused by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Certain Deferrals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your SemitePay account, we may delay settlement or restrict access to your funds while we do so. Additionally, we may delay settlement or restrict access to your funds if required to do so by law, court order or at the request of law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Account Statements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On demand, we will provide you with a statement detailing your account transaction and settlement history. Should you identify an error in the statement, you must notify us of such error within 30 calendar days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refunds-and-adjustments&quot;&gt;Refunds and Adjustments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Refund Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event that you wish to issue a refund to a purchaser, SemitePay can handle this. You can decide to issue a partial refund or the full amount of the initial purchase. You can also decide whether to issue the original amount of the invoice in your local currency or in the number of Bitcoins paid. If you do not have enough funds in your SemitePay account to cover the refund, SemitePay may require you to deposit Bitcoins into your SemitePay account to cover the refund to the purchaser. Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate determined by SemitePay, following the guidelines found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://semitepayment.com/exchange-rates&quot;&gt;https://semitepayment.com/exchange-rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Disclosure of Your Refund Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merchants are required to have a clear refund policy for their customers. We recommend you refund the amount of the initial purchase in the currency in which the item was priced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Purchaser Complaints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchasers filing complaints about a purchase will be forwarded to you for resolution. SemitePay reserves the right to terminate accounts which receive excessive complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

You will still be obligated to us for any fees incurred before the closure and we will remit to you funds not yet paid to you and associated with pre-closure sales. If your account balance is below our documented minimum transfer amount, you may be responsible for any transactions fees that may be incurred in the funds transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I asked to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find that you are asked to confirm your identity and other personal details. Skrill has established special verification systems involving your bank account or payment card to prove your identity. To safeguard the integrity of our payment system, your Skrill account may also be subject to periodic transaction limits depending on your user status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be asked to confirm your identity whether you are applying to be a new customer or have been a customer for some time. While our identity verification systems are designed to minimise any inconvenience for you, the verification process may take several days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crime and terrorism need cash. Criminals turn the &quot;dirty&quot; cash made from drug trafficking, smuggling, and robbery into clean money by using false identities or taking the names of innocent people - like you. Making sure that people are who they say they are is essential in the fight against crime and terrorism. This does not mean in any way that suspicion is falling on you. Any information about your identity is held confidentially and will help stop your identity being used falsely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HM Government and all organisations involved in financial services. All are united in their determination to stop the spread of financial crime as part of the international effort to crack down on financial crime - protecting us all against crime and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your co-operation is vital to the successful fight against crime and terrorism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) law requires:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We may be required to verify your identity and address.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are required to keep full records of all transactions together with identification provided.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are required to monitor any unusual or suspicious transactions of any size.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We have a legal obligation to report to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) any suspicious transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your personal information. You accept this policy when you sign up for or use our products, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities offered by us on our website or through any other means. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the change on the &quot;Privace Policy&quot; area of our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;info-collection&quot;&gt;How we collect information about you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you visit the SemitePay website or use the SemitePay Services, we collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you open an account or use the SemitePay Services, we may collect the following types of information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Contact information: your name, address, phone, email, Skype ID and other similar information.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Financial information: the full bank account numbers that you link to your SemitePay account or give us when you use the SemitePay Services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before permitting you to use the SemitePay Services, we may require you to provide additional information we can use to verify your identity or address or manage risk, such as your date of birth, social security number or other information. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are using the SemitePay Services, we collect information about your transactions and your other activities on our website or using the SemitePay Services and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cookies&quot;&gt;How we use cookies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called &quot;cookies&quot; on your computer. We and our service providers also use cookies to customize the SemitePay Services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We send a &quot;session cookie&quot; to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the SemitePay Services. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we do not need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. We may also collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the SemitePay Services on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protect-and-store&quot;&gt;How we protect and store personal information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this policy, we use the term &quot;personal information&quot; to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US and elsewhere in the world where SemitePay facilities are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;info-use&quot;&gt;How we use the personal information we collect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;provide the SemitePay Services and customer support you request;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;process transactions and send notices about your transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;customize, measure, and improve the SemitePay Services and the content and layout of our website and applications;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marketing&quot;&gt;Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize the SemitePay Services, content and advertising. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate your preference by logging into your account and going to the Profile subtab under the My Account tab and adjusting your preferences under Account Information, or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;info-sharing&quot;&gt;How we share personal information with other SemitePay users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified SemitePay users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other SemitePay users who you transact with through SemitePay. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access the SemitePay Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to enable the SemitePay Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are buying goods or services and pay through SemitePay, we may also provide the seller with your confirmed credit card billing address to help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the sellers address so that goods can be returned to the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using SemitePay. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party. We use this information to confirm to that you are a SemitePay customer and that SemitePay as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a SemitePay customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and SemitePay may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.&lt;/p&gt;
